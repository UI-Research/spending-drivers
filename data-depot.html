Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p class = "dd-desc">Medicaid spending is divided among four different subgroups with different eligibility characteristics in each. It is possible to construct our spending decomposition within each of these four categories, so we provide data on population, potentially eligible population, eligibility, recipients and expenditures for each of these groups. The four groups are children (ages 0 to 18), nondisabled adults (ages 19 to 64), disabled adults and children (ages 0 to 64), and the elderly (age 65 and older).  This subgroup calculation requires using a source for the expenditure data separate from that used for the full dataset.</p>
