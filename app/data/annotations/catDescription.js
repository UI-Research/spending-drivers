var CAT_DESCRIPTIONS = {
	"environment": "Environment and housing is a broad category encompassing spending on housing and community development, parks and recreation, natural resources, utilities (gas, electric, water), and other enterprise activities such as sewerage and solid waste or garbage collection and disposal.",
	"admin": "Government administration includes spending on finance, judicial and legal, central staff services, general public buildings, and other miscellaneous categories.",
	"medicaid": "Medicaid is states’ single largest budget item, representing more than one quarter of total spending (including federal funds) in fiscal 2015. The program has grown twice as fast as state revenues in recent years and, together with other health related costs, ranks as one of the state and local public sector’s most pressing long term fiscal challenges. This section focuses on how demographics, eligibility rules, and take-up rates work together to shape Medicaid caseloads. It also shows how Medicaid spending per recipient varies by state. Spending differences may be attributable to variation in provider fees, managed care, or geographic differences in the costs of medical service more generally. We also note where states differ in their enrollments of aged and disabled versus adult and children eligibility groups. Although they represent only about a quarter of beneficiaries nationally, the aged and disabled account for roughly two-thirds of total Medicaid costs.",
	"higher": "Public colleges and universities consume roughly ten percent of combined state and local budgets. Because tuition and fees are such an important part of the higher education funding picture, we focus on “net support” for higher education, or total state and local spending minus revenues from students. Note that this category includes nearly all activities undertaken by higher education institutions, including instruction, research, and administration as well as libraries, dormitories, cafeterias, and bookstores, but excluding university-affiliated hospitals. As with elementary and secondary education, we consider the contributions of enrollments (or full-time equivalent students) to spending apart from the costs for each student.",
	"k12": "Nearly 1 of every 5 dollars in state and local spending (from their own as well as federal funds) goes to elementary and secondary education. Education is also tremendously popular with voters, consistently ranking as their top spending priority in public opinion polls. This section delves into how states compare on spending for public schools and related activities including libraries, administration, counseling services, and transportation. By breaking spending per capita into its component parts, it shows how having more students in a state increases the cost of public education. For example, doubling spending per pupil is a lot more expensive when there are already twice as many students in one state compared to another. These breakdowns also show the effects of staffing levels and average employee compensation on spending per student.",
	"safety": "The public safety category describes state and local spending on police, fire, and corrections. Often, because it is impossible to exclude people from services, we focus on population as the measure of program caseloads or recipients.",
	"social": "State and local governments spent just under 4 percent of their total budgets on social services (excluding Medicaid) in fiscal 2012. Perhaps the best known of these programs is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides cash assistance and a range of services including child care, education and job training, and transportation to needy families with children. States have considerable latitude in setting benefit levels and eligibility rules as long as they can show that they are deploying federal and their own funds to meet TANF’s statutory goals. Our analysis considers spending from both federal and state TANF (maintenance of effort) funds. Caseloads are all persons receiving funds, including adults and children regardless of family status. We also analyze the role of poverty, eligibility rules, and take up or participation rates in determining caseloads in addition to showing spending per case.<div class = \"spacer\"></div>This section also includes state and local spending on child care subsidies to low and moderate income families from the federal Child Care Development Fund (CCDF). It further includes spending on child care as well as a range of community-based programs geared toward preventing child abuse and neglect, assisting with foster care and adoptions, and protecting the elderly and disabled under federal Social Services Block Grants (SSBG).<div class = \"spacer\"></div>Another section provides detail on the Supplemental Security Income program administered by the federal government but supplemented by the states to maintain income security for the aged, blind, and disabled. Beyond SSI, states have the option of administering additional aid through the State Supplementary Program (SSI/SSP). States may administer additional aid themselves, or contract with the federal government to do so. Combined SSI/SSP benefit levels indirectly determine eligibility thresholds.",
	"transportation": "States and localities spent about 8 percent of their combined budgets on highways, transit, and other forms of transportation including airports, water transport, and parking in fiscal 2012. We focus on the two largest categories: highways and transit. Highways encompasses spending on roads, streets, highways, and freeways. Transit includes spending on public transit agencies as well as subsidies to private companies providing commuter services. <div class = \"spacer\"></div>For highways, we consider several contributions to caseloads: population over driving age, population with drivers licenses, vehicle miles traveled per driver, and lane miles per vehicle miles traveled. Similarly, for transit, we look into the number of individual trips, passenger miles, and transit way miles. As in higher education, we consider spending net of revenues, or tolls and fares."
