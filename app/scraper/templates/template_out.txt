Wyoming spent more per capita on higher education than any other state in 2012. Although the state was home to only slightly more college-aged residents than average, these individuals were more likely to enroll in public colleges, rather than private. Among the other top ten states, Arkansas and New Mexico also had average demographics but high public university enrollment rates. High enrollment may stem from low tuition and fees: these states all ranked near the bottom in costs for four-year, in-state students.

New Hampshire, one of the lowest spenders per capita, has relatively low public college enrollment along with some of the highest tuition and fees (ranked second to Vermont). Looking at this data alone, it’s hard to tell whether New Hampshire spends less because it has fewer students, or whether its high tuition rate generates enough revenue to offset most of its spending. Looking at gross spending, however, can help clear things up. When you compare the state rankings in gross spending per capita and net spending per capita, you see that factoring in revenue doesn’t change much—the biggest net spenders are also the biggest gross spenders. This indicates that tuition does not contribute enough revenue to shift spending per capita numbers directly, meaning, in New Hampshire, that the state is spending very little and bringing in very little.

There isn’t huge variation across states in the proportion of college-aged residents. The national average is 10 percent, ranging from 9 percent in New Jersey to 14 percent in DC. These numbers also take into account students who move to a different state for college. So, a first year college student who grew up in Nebraska but moved to California for college would be counted as a California resident in this section.

Across the United States, about 21 percent of first time college students attend a college out of state. There is a substantial amount of variation among states – out-of-state students make up 6 percent of the student population in Texas and 71 percent in Vermont – but most of this can be explained by the relative sizes of the state’s local populations. Migration does not seem to drive demographic rankings, however: despite the differences in the proportion of out-of-state students, Texas and Vermont had a similar share of college-aged students.

Interestingly enough, more students are enrolled in college than there are 18-24 year olds (plus or minus net migration) in three states: Iowa, Arizona, and DC. This could be because of very high enrollment figures in older or younger age groups, or it could be that some college students are not being accounted for in official net migration figures.

Alaska and Nevada have similarly low rates of college attendance—42 and 47 percent, respectively—but they tell very different stories. Alaska is one of the highest spenders per capita on higher education, while Nevada is one of the lowest. The driving factor here appears to be the number of employees per student: Alaska ranks third in the country on this metric, while Nevada is 52nd. Since salaries and capital expenditures in both states are more or less the same, it seems that the factor most closely linked to spending is staffing levels. Whether the staffing levels determine spending or spending determines the number of employees, however, is a different question.

There is a general trend visible here that the states with the highest public university enrollment rates spend more, and the states with low public enrollment rates spend less. Utah and Iowa, however, stand out as two notable exceptions, ranking near the bottom in take-up rate but in the top 15 in spending. This is because when you look at demographics and takeup decisions together, Iowa and Utah both spend a lot per recipient. This is a worthwhile lesson – while disaggregated statistics can in most cases reveal more about spending decisions, we have to be careful not to lose the forest for the trees.

When we talk about public school enrollment, we include both 2- and 4-year institutions. In the United States as a whole, 46 percent of public college enrollment in the fall of 2012 was in 2-year colleges. Wyoming has the highest percentage, with 61 percent of students enrolled in 2-year programs, while Montana has the lowest, with 17 percent (Although Alaska doesn’t even have a Community College system). However, there is little correlation between high 2-year enrollment and high public school enrollment overall. For example, both Montana and Wyoming Rank in the top 5 states by public school takeup.

California is the only one of the 10 highest spending states to have less than the national average number of employees per student. This indicates that while decisions about the number of people to employ may drive spending in some states, in California other factors are at work. These factors likely include the high rate of college-aged residents, the high salaries, and relatively high capital costs in 2012. KIM, any ideas about what is going on?

There does appear to be a relationship between employees per student and spending, though the correlation is not a strong one. Other factors, such as salary or public university enrollment, seem to moderate how strong an impact employment levels have on spending.

Payroll spending in higher education seems to be largely driven by labor market conditions. Four of the top five states (CA, NJ, CT, PA) in this category are places you would expect to offer high salaries based on the cost of living in those areas. And for these states, there does not appear to be a link between high payroll spending and high spending per capita.  John to add chart.

DC spent more than twice the national average on capital costs and other nonpayroll expenses, yet it was the lowest spenders per capita. This makes some sense when you remember that DC does not have a large system of colleges within the district, so would employ few professors and employees. Combine this with DC’s pledge to provide up to $10,000 per resident for in-state tuition at university systems across the country, and high spending per employee seems reasonable.

There is often a great deal of news around large waves of construction in higher education, and it is possible to break out capital spending from other forms of non-payroll expenditures. On average, the United States spent $190 per capita on capital expenditures, but some states spend much more, with Delaware spending $416 per capita and Hawaii $363 per capita. However, there is no correlation between high capital spending and high non-payroll spending. This is potentially because non-payroll spending is driven in large part by decisions regarding the mechanical role of the number of employees in the calculation.

States that spent the most on housing and community development in 2012 were generally richer than average (Data Cite - Population, Area, Density and Economics), but most had many “very” and “extremely” low income households, as defined by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. They also had relatively high enrollment in state and federal housing programs, with the exception of California.

High spending states spent a lot on each housing recipient, though states spent money in different ways. Alaska, DC, Massachusetts, and New York spent more money on employees, while Louisiana, Maine, and Vermont spent more on non-payroll costs. This pattern may reflect the fact that in non-urban states, the costs of raw materials, rather than workers, drive costs. 

State and local governments are often charged with constructing and maintaining public housing projects, providing rent subsidies, programs for urban renewal, and other programs in a urban or rural area designed to expand access to housing and support local communities. These programs are often targeted at and used by low-income individuals, so we use data from the Urban Institute Housing Finance Policy Center on low-income individuals as the target demographic. The recipients of these programs are those individuals who receive some form of housing support, which we calculate based on Current Population Survey Data.

States with the highest participation rates in state and federal housing programs are divided, with some having large numbers of low-income individuals per capita (HI, RI, MA, DC) and others having exceptionally low numbers (SD, AK, WY). While this at first seems perplexing, when you break out the numbers to look at recipients per capita, all of the states in the top 10 by takeup are in the top 20 by recipients per capita, which is not the case for demographics. This does not imply the demographics are not important, some of the highest spending states have lots of low income individuals, but that when it comes to determining how many people actually are sitting in low-income housing, take-up rates may be the dominant factor.

Most of the states with the highest share of low-income residents receiving housing assistance did not provide many employees per recipient. These states on average have lower payroll costs for workers (although MT is an exception), so exorbitant labor costs are not preventing these states from hiring. It appears to be that the force driving employment is separate from the number of recipients. 

 


 There is only a modest link between employees per recipient and average waiting times for federal housing assistance.

You’d expect the states with large low-income populations would spend more per capita on housing assistance—and generally, that trend holds true. But Wisconsin and Nevada are notable exceptions, ranking among the lowest in spending per capita, despite their relatively large low-income populations. Both of these states have low enrollment rates, few employees and low nonpayroll costs. It is hard to say whether the low spending is driving low enrollment or vice versa, but it’s likely these factors explain the deviation from the pattern.

One way to assess the efficacy of a housing program is to look at wait times for affordable housing. You might expect that with more low-income people, there would be longer wait times. But the data for 2012 show no correlation between the number of low-income people per capita and how long one has to wait for affordable housing.

Alaska has one of the smallest low-income populations proportionately, yet it is one of the biggest spenders and provides the most employees per recipient. Alaska sits in the middle of the pack when it comes to total number of employees (35th out of 51), but at the bottom when it comes to recipients or eligible population (49th and 47th respectively). Alaska is choosing to employ a lot more people, unrelated to the actual number of recipients. This may be because Alaska is simply so much larger, with a proportionally large low-income populations spread out, which requires separate staffing.

It might be surprising that states with larger low-income populations also pay housing workers higher salaries, but the labor market conditions in those states might explain this discrepancy. Nine out of the top ten states by payroll per employee are compelled by labor market conditions to pay very high wages for workers with the level of education expected of housing employees. Interestingly enough, for the four states with the highest payroll per unit, the government is paying their housing employees thousands of dollars more than the comparable wages earned by workers with comparable levels of education.

The highest government administration spenders in 2012 were mostly a mix of low population states (Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, and Montana) and high cost-of-living states (California, New York, , and Connecticut). For Alaska and other small states, high spending per capita could simply be a result of having fewer people to share the fixed costs of buildings and certain administrative activities, like tax collection.

Many states that spent a lot on government administration in 2012 employed a lot of workers. Alaska and DC employed eight full-time workers for every 1,000 residents, and also paid some of the highest salaries. When governments employ more public administrative workers per capita, wait times may be shorter, court proceedings may go faster, and regulations may be more likely to be enforced.

There is not a clear relationship between government staffing levels and public opinion of state government, based on Gallup’s 50-State Poll. For example, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, and Texas had the lowest staffing levels. Illinois and North Carolina ranked first and ninth respectively in the proportion of residents who trusted government “not very much” or “none at all.” However, most residents in Texas (72 percent) and Indiana (68 percent) trusted government either “a fair amount” or “great deal”, placing both in the top 10 states by positive trust ratings (Data Cite – Trust in Government).

A state’s payroll spending is driven by both labor market conditions and policy decisions. However, it is difficult to isolate the two factors for government employees because the category encompasses so many different fields and types of workers. For example, in DC, attorneys working in local government are paid less than the average DC lawyer, but government financial officers are paid $17,000 more than the average DC finance officer. As a result, it’s hard to say much about state policy choices.

Unlike other spending categories, there is no clear relationship between payroll and non-payroll spending in administration. In fact, among the five states with the highest salaries, there are two of the highest non-payroll spenders and two of the lowest. A major driver of non-payroll spending are capital projects, but out of these five states, you have a mix of high capital spending (CA and NV), low capital spending (NJ), and mid-range capital spending (DC and AK).

You probably think public administration spending is driven by payroll, but the data here show, with the exception of DC, a clear relationship between non-payroll spending and spending per capita. This can be partially explained by the presence of two census expenditure categories – public buildings and other general expenditures. Both of these contribute 44% of total spending in this area, and have low payroll spending.

States that spent more per capita generally charged more in fees per capita, as well. 

With many natural resources—take fisheries, for example--the government spends money on maintaining those resources but also collects fees for their use. To calculate spending per capita, we subtracted the revenue a state earned from the amount it spent on natural resources. States with higher spending per capita also have higher fees and charges.

The strong correlation between high spending and high fees breaks down slightly when you look at charges per dollar of spending. Across states, fees and charges don’t grow faster that spending. For example, the top spenders per capita have some of the highest fees, but have a mix of very high and very low fees per dollar of spending.

Contrasting the spending of these four states – two high spenders and two low-spenders per capita – sheds little light on the actual driver of natural resources spending. All four states have high payroll and non-payroll per capita, and three out of the four have very low numbers of employees per capita (NV has only a middling number). Yet NV and IA have high spending while NY and CT have low spending.  The picture becomes clearer, however, when you look at population density: NY and CT are two of the densest states, while IA and NV are not. This trend makes sense, because housing natural resources requires space, which can be hard to come by in a densely populated state. Density does not explain every trend, but it is a helpful indication that other factors are at play. (CITE density)

Alaska stands out as the only top-five spenders with below-average non-payroll spending. While nationwide non-payroll spending was a bigger driver of overall spending, Alaska’s spending appears to be driven more by its salaries and number of employees. With more ground to cover,a greater focus on natural resources, and low population, it is unsurprising that Alaska would have the most employees per capita and therefore payroll spending would have a greater effect on total spending.

Though DC paid  higher salaries than any state, the difference in its nonpayroll spending is much more dramatic, and it is likely nonpayroll spending is driving DC’s high spending per capita. Recall that DC is a major city and may have to spend quite a bit more on parks and recreation facilities (pools, parks, etc…) that are comment in cities. This spending area also contains certain larger recreational institutions that are common in DC – like the Smithsonian – that may drive up costs.

DC spent almost $95,000 per employee, and SD, ID, and AK were all in the top ten states by capital investment per employee.

Many of the expenditure figures are negative in this spending area because state and local governments charge substantial fees for use of electrical utilities. These both pay for current spending and for past capital projects. This means that a state’s per capita spending ranking can say something about a state’s decision regarding spending or fees. For example, 6 out of the top ten states by spending actually have below-average total expenditures, but they have proportionally lower fees. The bottom ten states by per capita spending all have well above average total expenditures, but have much higher fees!

Among the states that provided the most employees per resident, there is an interesting mix of very high (AK and IN) and very low (NE, WA, and AZ) spenders. Since all of these states offered similar salaries to electric workers, it appears that some factor other than personnel costs are  driving spending. Two potential culprits are non-payroll spending and charges. Indeed, the low spenders in this group did not have large capital expenditures in 2012, while the high spenders did.

There is no census data on either Hawaii or the District of Columbia, however, these states are not quite the outliers they appear. Other states – like New Hampshire and Montana – report fewer than 5 employees overall. This is because these states do not have any sort of major public electrical utility, perhaps relying instead on private companies or on programs of other states. We can attribute the smattering of employees in a few states not as evidence of tiny electrical utility offices, but as anomalies in the way states report data to the census bureau.

West Virginia and New Hampshire are among the lowest spenders on payroll and nonpayroll expenses and have very low relative staffing levels—so, you might expect they’d be some of the lowest spenders per capita. But in fact, both these states are above average in spending per capita, likely because they aren’t collecting as much in fees as some other states. Since spending is the net of fee revenue and expenditures, it seems these two states’ low spending numbers are offset by relatively low revenues.

States with high net spending per capita have lower relative charges and fees than states with lower net spending per capita. In fact, we can divide the states into three groups – states where current and capital spending exceeds the revenue from charges, states with little or no spending, and states where the revenue from charges exceeds spending. This latter group is the biggest, potentially because many states have high charges to pay for past or expected capital projects not currently on the books.

The states with no employees and some spending (while generally low) are harder to explain, but might be attributed to the use of contractors or the purchase or some gas-related function (like the purchase or sale of gas) that is counted in gas supply under census expenditure codes but may be handled by financial administrative workers.

While not universally true, the trend is for denser states to have fewer units per recipients. This could be true because denser states have more people overall, or perhaps it is the case that there is a fixed cost in terms of employees not in terms of people served but in terms of area covered by water infrastructure. If more people occupy fewer miles, then fewer employees are required per person.

This can be traced to both the strong role of capital spending and charges in driving state spending on water supply. It is not the day-to-day operation of water supply systems, but the large infrastructure projects and fee systems designed to spread out the costs of such projects that drive spending.

As California and DC demonstrate, payroll expenses were not a major driver of sewerage costs. While California and DC paid their employees nearly the same amount, DC was the biggest overall spender per capita, while California was near the bottom. This is in large part due to differences in staffing—DC provides far more employees per resident—and nonpayroll expenses—DC invested far more in capital projects. The trends in payroll in this category seem to reflect cost of living differences among the states, but these differences don’t play a large roll in affecting spending.

However, most states – including some in the top ten by payroll per unit (New Jersey, Alaska, and Massachusetts) – chose in 2012 to pay their employees less than labor market conditions alone would indicate.

There is almost a one-to-one relationship between spending per capita and nonpayroll spending, indicating that, as with most utilities categories, capital expenses were the largest driver of spending. Capital spending is variable across time – DC and Mississippi might be in the midst of large capita projects now, but this was not always the case.

Spending on the collection, removal, and disposal of garbage and other solid wastes and the cleaning of streets, alleys, and sidewalks is primarily a local rather than state responsibility. States with the highest combined state and local spending net of charges on this function in 2012 were a mix of places with high employment and high payroll costs (DC, New York, and new Jersey) as well as places with high non-payroll, including capital spending (Hawaii and Rhode Island).

State and local governments often charge a fee for utility services like solid waste management. Some states have spending per capita numbers that are negative, which means that they make more in fees than they spend on garbage pickup, street cleaning, and the other element of solid waste management. Spending per capita figures are therefore a function of three elements – actual expenditures, population, and charges – meaning that states can rank high if they spend a lot, have low charges, or have a relatively low population for their spending level.

A big factor in solid waste payrolls appears to state decisions to pay their workers more or less than labor market conditions would demand. States who rank highly appear to have wages in excess of what a standard worker with some college education, while low-ranked states pay their workers far less.

In many cases non-payroll spending could be driven by capital spending – money directed to large construction projects and the like. Capital spending is distributed randomly in a few states (like Nevada) and has little effect on general spending.

States at or near the bottom in K-12 spending per capita were also home to more school aged kids than average (except for Florida and Hawaii). Offsetting this demographic effect were low enrollments in school in Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Nevada and, to a lesser extent, North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona. However, kids in these states who did attend school were more likely to enroll in public, rather than private, school.

We also examined reading and math test scores for 4th and 8th graders on the National Assessment of Educational Performance. States in the top ten for spending per capita reflect both high (Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont) and low (DC, CA) test scores. There was no clear pattern between test scores and spending per pupil or the number of teachers and other employees per pupil.

Except Wyoming, the states with the highest rate of public school enrollment among school-going children were also some of the lowest spenders, despite also having more school-aged kids than average. This implies that take-up rate does not drive school spending, nor do state decisions about how much to spend on education influence parents’ decisions about enrolling their children in public versus private schools. In addition, these states all had some of the lowest levels of private schools per capita, leaving few alternatives other than public school (Data Cite – Public and Private Data)

With the exception of Hawaii, states with the lowest rate of public school enrollment were actually among the biggest spenders. These states, again with a few exceptions, were also not home to very many school-aged kids to start with. So what’s going on? Many of these states spent a lot on payroll, probably because they are expensive places to live. But some (especially New York and Nebraska) also employed a lot of teachers and other school employees. They also had higher non-payroll costs (such as capital costs in DC). These states can afford to spend more on payroll and other costs because they have fewer kids.

How did states with the most school-aged kids and higher take-up rates manage to spend less per capita on K-12 education? By spending less per employee – including both teachers and other staff members. These states also paid less than expected based on labor market conditions in those states. The chart below shows that the states ranked highest by kids per capita all pay their K-12 employees at least $4400 dollars less than the relative value of a bachelor’s degree in that state.

Some of the states with very few school-aged children per capita spent very little money on education, as you might expect, but some spent a lot. Looking at the states with the fewest children, it is clear that there is no correlation between spending and share of children who could be in school, so there must be other factors driving education spending. (Richard and Kim, any thoughts on why)

Vermont, Wyoming, and New Hampshire had the most public elementary and secondary education employees per student in 2012. This helps to explain why the states were all in the top ten for spending per capita and spending per pupil, even though they had only average payroll costs per employee. The New England states also could afford more employees per student since they ranked near the bottom in students per capita.

DC stands out as one of the only high-spending states with lower than average staffing levels (most high spending states have a lot of employees). This could be because DC’s spending per employee on both payroll and non-payroll costs was so much higher than any state’s, or because it’s public school enrollment rate is very low.

Many states in the top ten for payroll costs per K-12 education employee were also among the top states in average spending per capita. This trend continues on down to the lowest payroll states, and suggests that, to some extent, payroll costs are a driver of state education spending. It’s worth noting, however, that the high payroll states are a mix of high cost of living states - like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York - and states with proportionally few employees – DC, Minnesota, Maryland, and Rhode Island. Some of these states may have been able to afford higher salaries because they employed fewer people.

State payroll in this category is not just driven by labor market conditions – the relative price demanded for a particular education level – but by choices made by state and local governments. Looking at the figure below of the top and bottom ten states by payroll per employee, it is clear that the same states with low payroll are charging over $5,000 less than the relative price for a bachelor’s degree, and states with high payroll are charging between $700 and $11,500 more.

You might expect that states that spent a lot on nonpayroll costs, such as capital expenditures or employee benefits, would spend less on payroll. The data, however, show this is not the case. Instead, with a few exceptions, the states that spent a lot on nonpayroll costs also spent a lot on their employees. This may indicate that the same force drives both employment decisions, like hiring and payroll, and other education spending, as opposed to states with limited resources being forced to choose between the two.

Generally speaking, you can see a correlation between nonpayroll spending and spending per capita in K-12 education. New Hampshire and Vermont stand out, however. Despite being in the bottom half in terms of costs per employee—both salaries and non-personnel costs—these states are some of the biggest spenders per capita. This spending is likely driven by the fact that NH and VT employ more employees per student than almost any other state. So, while in some states (like Delaware or Rhode Island) spending per employee seems to drive costs, in these two New England states it appears staffing levels are a bigger driver.

When looking at the trends in K-12 education, it’s important to notice that there’s not a lot of variation nationally in the share of children who enroll in school. While enrollment rates for public school vary, the overall enrollment rate ranges from 97 to 99 percent. It’s not surprising, then, that there’s not clear link between enrollment rates and spending. States likely assume that just about all children will go to school, and whether the go to public or private school is more important to spending decisions. Those children not in public or private school are mainly older (16-19) students who do not have a degree and are not attending any sort of K-12 program.
