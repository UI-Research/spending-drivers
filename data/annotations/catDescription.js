var CAT_DESCRIPTIONS = {
	"environment": "Housing and environment is a broad category encompassing spending on public housing and community development, parks and recreation, natural resources, utilities (gas, electric, water), and other enterprise activities (sewerage and solid waste or garbage collection and disposal). For natural resources as well as utilities, sewerage, and solid waste, we subtract rate payments or fees that state and local governments collect from total spending so that we can capture the true cost to government of these services.",
	"admin": "Administration is one of the most common ways that people interact with their governments, whether in paying their state income taxes, having their day in court, or appearing before a local zoning board. This category of spending includes all financial, judicial and legal, legislative, and central staff services as well as general public buildings, local government support, and other miscellaneous activities.",
	"medicaid": "Medicaid is the country’s main vehicle for providing health care and insurance to the disadvantaged, including low-income children and families as well as the elderly and disabled. Although it is jointly funded by states and the federal government, states exercise discretion over who is eligible for Medicaid and what services participants receive beyond a basic benefits package. Medicaid is states’ <a href = \"http://www.nasbo.org/sites/default/files/State Expenditure Report %28Fiscal 2013-2015%29S.pdf\">single largest budget item</a> (including spending from federal funds). The program has grown <a href = \"http://www.statebudgetcrisis.org/wpcms/final-report-of-the-state-budget-crisis-task-force/sbctf_finalreport/\">twice as fast as state revenues</a> in recent years and, together with other health related costs, it is one of the state and local public sector’s most pressing <a href = \"http://www.gao.gov/fiscal_outlook/state_local_fiscal_model/overview#t=1\">long-term fiscal challenges</a>. The <a href = \"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43627.pdf.\">Children's Health Insurance Program</a> (CHIP) provides health insurance coverage to children and pregnant women in families not eligible for Medicaid because their incomes are too high. States may run CHIP as an expansion to Medicaid, a separate program, or some combination of these two approaches.",
	"higher": "Public colleges and universities consume roughly 10 percent of combined state and local budgets. Our analysis includes instruction, research, service, libraries, and administrative functions in both two- and four-year institutions but excludes activities that are largely self-supported, like dormitories, cafeterias, athletics, bookstores, and university-affiliated hospitals. Because tuition and fees are such an important part of the higher education <a hre = \"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/financing-public-higher-education-variation-across-states/view/full_report\">funding picture</a>, we focus on “net support” for higher education, or state and local spending minus tuition and other charges.",
	"k12": "About 1 out of every 5 dollars that state and local governments spend (from their own and federal funds) goes to elementary and secondary education. Education is also tremendously popular with voters, consistently ranking as their top spending priority in opinion polls. This section delves into how states compare on spending for public schools, including money spent on administration, school lunch programs, counseling services, and student transportation.",
	"safety": "State and local government spend about 7 percent of their combined budgets on public safety. This category includes police, fire protection, and corrections programs, which include local jails, probation and parole programs, state prisons, and education, training, and health care programs devoted to inmates.",
	"social": "State and local governments spend just under 4 percent of their total budgets on social services apart from Medicaid. Perhaps the best known of these programs is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides cash assistance and a range of services, including child care, education and job training, and transportation for needy families with children. States have <a href = \"http://anfdata.urban.org/databooks/Welfare Rules Databook 2013.pdf\">considerable latitude</a> in setting benefits and eligibility rules as long as they can show that they are deploying federal and state funds to meet TANF’s <a href = \"http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-an-introduction-to-tanf\">statutory goals</a>. This section also includes state and local spending from the federal <a href = \"http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/income-and-benefits-policy-center/projects/ccdf-policies-database\">Child Care Development Fund (CCDF)</a> on child care subsidies and other benefits to low- and moderate-income families.",
	"transportation": "States and localities spent about 8 percent of their combined budgets, in fiscal year 2012, on highways, transit, and other transportation, including airports, water transport, and parking. In this analysis, we focus on the two largest components of transportation spending: highways and transit. The highways category encompasses spending on roads, streets, bridges, tunnels, and freeways as well as street lighting and traffic signals. Transit includes spending on public transit agencies as well as subsidies to private companies providing commuter services. In both categories, we consider spending net of tolls, fares, and other user charges; we do not consider gas taxes, vehicle license fees, and other taxes reasonably related to road use."
